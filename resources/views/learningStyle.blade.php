                    Understanding how a child learns is critical for maximizing their educational potential. Every individual processes information differently, and recognizing these preferences helps optimize both teaching and learning strategies.
                    <br><br>
                    Unify Learning Styles assessment, based on research from the VARK model (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, and Kinesthetic), delves into how your child absorbs and retains information, providing you with the tools to tailor education to their strengths.
