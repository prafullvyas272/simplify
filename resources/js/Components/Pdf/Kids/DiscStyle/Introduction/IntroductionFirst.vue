                    into your child's unique personality traits, helping you understand how they engage with the world
                    around them. Our aim is to provide valuable information that will support you in nurturing and
                    guiding your child's growth and development.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    The DISC model is a highly effective tool for understanding behaviour and personality. It
                    categorises behaviour into four main styles: Dominant (D), Influential (I), Supportive (S), and
                    Cautious (C). Each style comes with its own strengths and areas for growth. By understanding your
                    child's DISC style, you can better support their learning, social interactions, and overall
                    development.

                <strong>Dominant (D):</strong> Children with a dominant style
                are often confident, assertive, and enjoy taking charge. They

            <li>
                <strong>Influential (I):</strong> Influential children are

            <li>
                <strong>Supportive (S):</strong> Children with a supportive style
                are calm, reliable, and enjoy working in stable environments.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cautious (C):</strong> Cautious children are
                detail-oriented, organised, and enjoy tasks that require
