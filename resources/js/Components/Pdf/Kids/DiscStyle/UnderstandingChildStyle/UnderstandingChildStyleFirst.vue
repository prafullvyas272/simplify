                    Children with a Cautious (C) style are often thoughtful and
                    reserved in social settings. They prefer smaller groups or
                    one-on-one interactions where they can have deeper
                    conversations. They are good listeners and often provide
                    thoughtful advice to their friends. Here are some key points
