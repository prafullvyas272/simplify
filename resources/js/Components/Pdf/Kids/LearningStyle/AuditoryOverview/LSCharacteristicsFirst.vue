                                through both written text and visual aids. They
                                excel at understanding concepts when they can
                                read about them and then reinforce their

                                and in writing. They benefit from creating
                                visual organisers and written outlines to
                                structure their learning, which helps them stay

                                concepts more easily. Visual aids help them
                                “see” the big picture, while writing allows them
                                to explain or summarise those concepts in
                                detail.

                                presentations, or participating in interactive

                                aids. They excel at understanding concepts when

                                their learning with diagrams, charts, or images.

                                organise their thoughts and study materials both
                                visually and in writing. They benefit from
                                creating visual organisers and written outlines
                                to structure their learning, which helps them
                                stay focused and productive.

                                concepts more easily. Visual aids help them
                                “see” the big picture, while writing allows them
                                to explain or summarise those concepts in
                                detail.

                                and ideas in written form. They are able to
                                clarify and expand on what they’ve learned by
                                writing essays, reports, or summaries.
