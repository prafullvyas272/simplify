                                    that is free from distractions and
                                    background noise. This helps your child
                                    focus on auditory tasks. Provide comfortable
                                    seating and ensure good lighting in the

                                    words. Use positive reinforcement such as
                                    verbal rewards and affirmations to motivate
                                    your child.

                        <strong>Encourage Active Listening:</strong> Teach your
                        child active listening skills. Encourage them to make
                        eye contact, nod, and ask questions during
                        conversations. Practice active listening exercises, such
                        as summarising what they heard or repeating instructions
                        back to you.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Set Up a Listening Routine:</strong> Establish a
                        routine that includes listening activities. Set aside
                        time each day for listening to audiobooks, music, or
                        educational podcasts. Use listening routines to
                        reinforce daily tasks and responsibilities.

                        <strong>Incorporate Technology:</strong> Use educational
                        apps and software that incorporate auditory learning
                        techniques. Many digital tools offer interactive and
                        auditory-rich content for various subjects. Encourage
                        your child to explore educational websites and online
                        resources that include audio elements.

                        <strong>Celebrate Verbal Achievements:</strong>
                        Celebrate your child's verbal achievements by
                        acknowledging their progress in speaking, listening, and
                        expressing ideas. Create a verbal achievement board
                        where your child can display their progress and
                        accomplishments.

                                        Support your child by encouraging them
                                        to plan their work visually, such as
                                        creating a mind map before writing a
                                        report. Once completed, have them write
                                        a reflection on the process. This
                                        combination of visual and written tasks
                                        helps them feel more confident in their
                                        abilities.

                                        For example, set up a chart where they
                                        can see their progress in schoolwork,
                                        and provide written rewards or notes of
                                        encouragement when they meet their
                                        goals. This appeals to both their visual

                                During discussions or lessons, teach your child
                                to actively listen and take visual notes, using
                                diagrams or charts to organise their thoughts.
                                This helps them stay engaged with both forms of
                                input.

                                interactive way.

                                make connections between visual input and verbal

                                to convert auditory information into visual
                                representations, enhancing understanding.

                                stay focused. Encourage short, active breaks
                                during study sessions to help your child
                                recharge. Physical activities like stretching or
                                a quick walk will help them return to their
                                studies with renewed focus and energy.

                                their study schedule and task lists. Use
                                calendars, charts, or visual planners to help
                                them see their progress. Allow them to
                                physically interact with their plans by crossing
                                off completed tasks or moving through different
                                study stations. This gives a sense of control
                                and accomplishment.

                                encourage them to complete the task physically.
                                For instance, show them a visual representation
                                of a science experiment, then allow them to
                                recreate the experiment themselves. This builds
                                confidence by ensuring they understand both the
                                visual and physical components.

                                a model or creating a visual presentation,
                                collaborative projects allow your child to use
