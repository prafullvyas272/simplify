                            information by listening. Whether through

                            information is presented verbally. Use this to your

                            You excel when you can see and hear information at
                            the same time. Make the most of your ability to
                            understand material through visual aids like charts
                            and diagrams, while reinforcing your learning by
                            listening to explanations or discussing concepts
                            with others.

                            Use a blend of visual and auditory strategies to
                            strengthen your understanding. For example, review
                            diagrams or notes while listening to recordings or
                            lectures. This combination of methods allows you to
                            take in information in multiple ways, improving
                            retention.

                            what you’ve learned, so use both visual and auditory
                            methods during review sessions to strengthen your
                            memory of key concepts.

                                    As a kinaesthetic learner, you thrive when
                                    you can engage physically with the material.
                                    Whether through hands-on projects, building
                                    models, or role-playing scenarios, you learn
                                    best by doing. Use this to your advantage in
                                    subjects that allow for practical
                                    applications.

                                    Keep your body active while studying by
                                    incorporating movement, such as pacing while

                                    models, or building kits. These tools allow
                                    you to manipulate objects while learning,

                            and writing. Make the most of your ability to absorb
                            complex concepts by engaging with written materials
                            such as textbooks, notes, and essays. Use this

                            Writing helps solidify your understanding of topics.
                            Whether you’re summarising information, taking
                            notes, or writing essays, engage in writing as much
                            as possible to strengthen your grasp of the
                            material.
