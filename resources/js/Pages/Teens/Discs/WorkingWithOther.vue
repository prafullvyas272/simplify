                    As someone with a Cautious (C) style, you bring
                    precision and analytical skills to group activities.
                    Here’s how you can work effectively with friends who
                    have different DISC styles:

                        Dominant friends are confident and
                        results-oriented. Appreciate their ability to
                        make quick decisions and lead projects. You can
                        support them by providing detailed information
                        and ensuring that the group’s work is accurate
                        and thorough.

                        Influential friends are energetic and creative.
                        Enjoy their enthusiasm and be open to their
                        ideas. Your ability to analyse and organise can

                        Supportive friends are patient and cooperative.
