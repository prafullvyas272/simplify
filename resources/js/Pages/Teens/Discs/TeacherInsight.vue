                    Welcome to the Teacher Insights section of the Teen DISC
                    Assessment Report. Understanding your students' unique
                    personality traits can help you create an engaging and
                    supportive learning environment. This section is designed to
                    provide practical strategies for teaching a student with a
                    Cautious (C) style. These students are often analytical,
                    detail-oriented, and methodical learners who thrive in
                    structured environments.
