                <li>
                    <strong>Methodical Approach:</strong> You prefer a
                    systematic way of tackling challenges, breaking down complex
                    tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This method helps you
                    stay organised and focused on your goals. You enjoy planning

                        <strong>Practice Assertiveness:</strong> Start by
                        expressing your opinions and needs in low-stakes
                        situations. Gradually build your confidence in more
                        challenging scenarios.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Make Quick Decisions:</strong> Practice making
                        decisions quickly by setting time limits for yourself.
                        Trust your instincts and learn from the outcomes

                    <li>
                        <strong>Set Boundaries:</strong> Learn to say no when
                        necessary and prioritise your well-being. Make time for
                        self-care and personal interests.

                        <strong>View Feedback Positively:</strong> When
                        receiving criticism, focus on the constructive aspects
                        and use it as an opportunity to improve.
