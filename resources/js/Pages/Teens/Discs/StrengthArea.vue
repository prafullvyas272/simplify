                    <strong>Analytical Thinker:</strong> You excel at analysing
                    information and identifying patterns. Your logical approach

                    mistakes. You take pride in your meticulous nature,
                    double-checking your work to ensure everything is correct.
                    This attention to detail is valuable in situations where
                    accuracy is essential, such as managing projects or
                    conducting research.

                <li>
                    <strong>Methodical Approach:</strong> You prefer a
                    systematic way of tackling challenges, breaking down complex
                    tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This method helps you
                    stay organised and focused on your goals. You enjoy planning
                    and structuring your work, which allows you to efficiently
                    complete tasks and meet deadlines. Your organised approach
                    ensures that nothing is overlooked and that all aspects of a

                    consistent approach helps you build trust with others and
                    achieve long-term success. People appreciate your
                    reliability and know they can rely on you to deliver on your

                        <strong>Practice Assertiveness:</strong> Start by
                        expressing your opinions and needs in low-stakes
                        situations. Gradually build your confidence in more
                        challenging scenarios.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Make Quick Decisions:</strong> Practice making
                        decisions quickly by setting time limits for yourself.
                        Trust your instincts and learn from the outcomes

                    <li>
                        <strong>Set Boundaries:</strong> Learn to say no when
                        necessary and prioritise your well-being. Make time for
                        self-care and personal interests.

                        <strong>View Feedback Positively:</strong> When
                        receiving criticism, focus on the constructive aspects
                        and use it as an opportunity to improve.
