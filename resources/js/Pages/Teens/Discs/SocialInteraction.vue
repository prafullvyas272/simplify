                        As someone with a Cautious (C) style, you bring
                        thoughtfulness and precision to your interactions with
                        others. Here’s how you typically interact with others:

                            You carefully consider your words before speaking,
                            ensuring your message is clear and accurate. You
                            take the time to listen to others and think about
                            their perspectives before responding, which helps
                            you build strong and meaningful connections.

                            You may prefer smaller groups or one-on-one
                            interactions, where you can have deeper
                            conversations. Large crowds or social gatherings
                            might feel overwhelming, but you thrive in
                            situations where you can focus on meaningful
                            interactions with a few people.

                            often picking up on details that others might miss.
                            This attention to detail allows you to understand
                            the nuances of conversations and respond
                            thoughtfully.

                            You enjoy engaging in intellectual conversations
                            where you can share ideas and learn from others.

                                Before expressing your thoughts, you analyse the
                                situation thoroughly. Your communication is
                                well-considered, and you focus on facts and
                                logic to support your points.

                                While you prefer to work independently, you can
                                collaborate effectively when needed. You bring
                                structure and direction to group discussions,
                                helping to keep the team focused on achieving

                                In social situations, you often focus on the
                                task at hand rather than on building
                                relationships. Your goal-oriented approach
                                ensures that objectives are met, but it’s
                                important to balance this with relational
                                interactions.

                                While it’s important to be direct, also consider
                                the feelings and perspectives of others. Empathy
